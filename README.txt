Documentation (other than this file) resides in the "doc" subdirectory.

The INSTALL.txt file has instructions for JWebMail users (i.e., you just
want to install and run the application), and for developers who want
to build JWebMail for customization or JWebMail-development purposes.

The LICENSE.txt file has the Apache 2.0 license which covers the base
JWebMail product.

JWebMail code contributors must also read the file doc/conventions.txt.
