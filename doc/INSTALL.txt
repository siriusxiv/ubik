Installation instructions for JWebMail
======================================


I. Requirements
===============

For running JWebMail you need the following software:

- A mailserver for sending (SMTP) and receiving (IMAP) mails; by default,
  JWebMail will use "localhost" for both
- A Java servlet container which supports the 2.4 servlet spec. and
  runs on a Java 1.5 or greater
  JVM (either JRE or JDK).  Anything from a stripped down servlet-container
  like Tomcat, to a J2EE application server like JBoss or
  WebSphere will work.
- Your servlet container needs modern versions of the following libraries
  installed:
      JavaMail API (typically mailapi-*.jar)
      JavaMail SMTP provider (typically smtp-*.jar)
      JAF/Java Activation Framework (not necessary if your servlet container
               runs Java 1.6, since Java 1.6 includes the activation
               framework).

If you wish to build a custom app, or develop, you will also need a
standalone Java JDK 1.5 or later, and Ant 1.7 or later, as described below.
Any or no Java IDE will work.


II. Installation
================

There are two approaches to installing JWebMail >= 0.7.7, both require a
servlet container as described above.

1. Installation of a pre-compiled WAR-file (Webapp Archive)
2. Build and install from source

The first installation method is almost always the preferred choice. Building
from source may be relevant to you if you need to do modifications to the
source.

1. Installation of a pre-built WAR-file
---------------------------------------

This installation method is very simple:

Install "jwebmail.war" as you would install any War file.

With Tomcat, the easiest way is to use the Manager webapp, which serves
http://localhost:8080/manager/html by default.  Log in and deploy the
war using the Gui (you can see or add manager accounts in the file
$CATALINA_BASE/config/tomcat-users.xml).

For every application server that I know of, if you have auto-deploy on
(usually the default mode) you can become the app-server "owner" (the
account under which the server process(es) run), and just copy the war
file into the webapp landing directory.  If you don't have access to that
account, see your app server docs, because the war file permission
requirements vary (if you have superuser privileges, you can always
change the file to be owned by the app-server owner).  Rest assured,
your app server has several easy ways to deploy war files.

JWebMail is then available by visiting http://yourhost:PORT/jwebmail
with a web browser.

Please don't forget to visit the administration interface first. You can access
it by browsing http://yourhost:PORT/jwebmail/WebMail/admin.  Initial password
is "Secret".

See the document "jwebmail-guide.html" in your distribution.


2. Build and install from source
--------------------------------

JWebMail is compiled by using the Ant build-system.  You will need Ant
version 1.7 or greater and Java JDK 1.5 or greater to build JWebMail.

You can obtain the JWebMail source code by extracing a source code
distribution package, or by exporting or checking out our code from
SourceForge.  You can get our distro packages at 
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2056 .
You can use any Subversion client to get our trunk code from
https://jwebmail.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jwebmail/trunk .

The following steps are required (for a quick-start):
1. Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable (to the directory where the JDK is
   installed)
2. Make sure that the "bin" directory of your Ant installation is in your
   search path.  Run "ant -v" to verify.
3. You will need Internet access the first time you run the build, so that
   the build process can download the needed third party libraries
   (automatically).
4. Just run 'ant' to build a war file in subdirectory "dist".
   If you don't have an Ivy jar file in your CLASSPATH, the Ant command
   above will display the simple command that you can copy-and-paste to your
   command line to satisfy it.
   An error message like '...doesn't support the nested "matches" element...'
   means you need to upgrade Ant to 1.7 or later.
5. Deploy the file at dist/jwebmail.jar to your servlet container, as
   explained in the previous section.
   Alternatively, you set Ant property 'exploded.dir'
   and deploy the exploded webapp to a live deployment directory.
   Since you are building software, we figure you
   are handy enough to figure this out without further instruction from us.
6. Run "ant javadoc gen-guide" to build the API spec docs and
   jwebmail-guide.html file referred to in the previous section.
   (They get written to the build/apidocs and doc subdirectories respectively).

IDE developers need to see the JWebMail User's Guide (this document explains
where to get it).

Run "ant -p" for further possible targets that may be used.
To customize any Ant properties, create a standard Java properties file in
this directory with name "local.properties".

The "gen-guide" task requires the program "xsltproc".
You have a few alternatives to access a User's Guide if you don't have xsltproc.
  + Read it online at http://jwebmail.sourceforge.net/jwebmail-guide.html .
    Just be aware that it's not guaranteed to match the version of JWebMail
    that you are working with.
  + Use your own XSLT processor program to generate jwebmail-guide.html file
    from the guide.* artifacts in the doc-src directory.
  + Download the desired version of the binary distribution of
    JWebMail.  These include a pre-build User's Guide.

The build system uses Apache Ivy to fetch third party libraries.  The
configuration allows you to change the library repository location by
editing local.properties and ivy-settings.xml.  See
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ for details about Apache Ivy.
