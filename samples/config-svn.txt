### Section for configuring automatic properties.
[auto-props]
### The format of the entries is:
###   file-name-pattern = propname[=value][;propname[=value]...]
### The file-name-pattern can contain wildcards (such as '*' and
### '?').  All entries which match will be applied to the file.
### Note that auto-props functionality must be enabled, which
### is typically done by setting the 'enable-auto-props' option.

# The long-standing Subversion bug with svn:keywords value parsing seems to
# be fixed with recent Subversion builds.  No more need to quote the value!
# As noted in the Subversion docs, multiple patterns may be matched and
# applied to a single candidate file.  However,
# THE SAME PATTERN (EVEN DIFFERING IN CASE) CAN'T BE USED MORE THAN ONE TIME!
# If you use this, for example:
#     *.mytype = svn:mime-type=application/mt1
#     *.MYTYPE = svn:executable
# I also find that patterns can't begin with "[".  "*.[Mm]ake" works, but not
#  "[Mm]akefile".
# The first entry will be completely, and silently, ignored.
# Workaround is to permit all case-combinations with a single pattern, like
#     *.[Mm][Yy][Tt][Yy][Pp][Ee] = *.mytype = svn:mime-type=application/mt1;
#                                             svn:executable
# (Note the leading white space on the continuation line).
#
# Due to Subversion bug, we cannot set mime-types automatically for files
# with mime-type other than text/*.  Therefore, we just set the eol-style
# here and let the user set these mime types manually.
#
# I would like to use continuation lines, and more whitespace below, but
# the following constraints are imposed by terrible Subversive plugin
# Properties config importer parser.
#   + No continuation lines
#   + No white space between each property name and the following = char
#   + No white space after each ; separator

# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_type#List_of_common_media_types ,
# for consistency.

# STRAIGHT BINARY TYPES
# I believe that all mime types other than text/* are treated as binary.
# (This means that you can't use script mime types like
# application/x-shellscript).  application/octet-stream pretty much means
# "binary without specific standard mime type"              --b

# SCRIPTS
# There's no perfect EOL solution for scripts.
# Some UNIXes can only read the interpreter specification line if it
# is terminated with just \n, but it's also very convenient for non-UNIX
# users to be able to use native editors on these scripts.
# Also no perfect solution for setting Executability, since env-setup
# scripts should be "sourced", and "included" PHP libraries, etc.,
# should not be executable.  Since for the first case we usually want them
# to be executable, and the last not, these are the defaults I'm setting.
# Users can then override the executable property manually for exceptions.
# As noted above, can't set mime type unless the mime type
# begins with "text/", or Subversion will treat them as binaries.  --b
